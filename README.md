# AI-Driven Tool for Automated Forensic Timeline Analysis (Frontend)
An AI-driven tool designed to automate forensic timeline analysis. This repository contains the frontend code for this tool. This React-based application provides an interface to identify attack patterns based on forensic data and generate detailed reports. The frontend communicates with the backend service at [AI-Driven Tool for Automated Forensic Timeline Analysis](https://github.com/MeenakshiPathiyil/AI-Driven-Tool-for-Automated-Forensic-Timeline-Analysis) to process and analyze forensic data, enabling users to detect security incidents.
